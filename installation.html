    <p>The Visual Alphabet Installation allows users to type words or
        sentences into a system that generates a layered video. Users can
        explore words of their own personal motifs or enjoy creating
        visuals based on the diverse video elements. Every letter of the
        alphabet has been assigned a different visual and is layered in
        varied opacities to create the submitted words.
    </p>

    <p>Users simply type their desired word and hit the spacebar on the 
        device to generate the video. This installation is most effective
        when projected, but can also exist on a computer moniter.
